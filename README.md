## UX

Thinking about the design was really simple, So I kept as simple and clean as possible.

The site flow is pretty basic, but efficient. The users can add items to their shopping bag and see the running total as they browse the site. This is a essential function to easy the buying process.

I've included an footer with a signup form where users can receive exclusive offers and discount codes by subscribing to the newsletter.

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to generate my colour palette.



### Typography

I used Google Fonts to select and import the font Poppins, including for main headers and the logo because it is modern but easily readable at the same time. [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all the text.



### Images and Post Content

All the house images on the site were gathered on [Freepik](hhttps://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/indian-house/80) website.
The blog posts were oginaly published by []() magazine.

### Wireframes

I've used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design my site wireframes.

## Agile Development Process

### Strategy

 This project uses Agile Methodology. A planning session generated 34 Tasks through 29 User Stories and 8 Epics, each one with their acceptance criterias. 2 of then was not implemented and they are listed in the "Features to Implement in the Future" session. The development process was based on iterative incremental philosophy, adopting 1 week sprints with the following goals:

- <strong>Week 1</strong>: Basic structure and features running with boilerplate design and content.
- <strong>Week 2</strong>: CRUD functionalities of product section running with boilerplate design and content.
- <strong>Week 3</strong>: CRUD functionalities of blog section + Final version of the design and content + Messages.
- <strong>Week 4</strong>: Testing, final deploy and documentation.

### GitHub Projects

For this project, GitHub Projects was utilized as an Agile tool. While it's not a specialized tool, it can be customized with the appropriate tags and project creation/issue assignments to make it effective. User stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned using it, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![kanban-board] 

### GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues served as an another Agile tool for manage the issues throughout the development process.

![github-issues] 

### MoSCoW Prioritization

For prioritization, I used the MoSCow framework, adding labels to my tasks and user stories within the Github Issues.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: This will not be worked on

## User Stories

In order to enhance the efficiency of this project's development process, I mapped out 34 tasks through 29 user stories to build the website to a good standard. In addition, I splited these user stories into epics in order to take an agile approach towards their development.

## Database Design

Before starting code and create models, I built a Relationship Diagrams (ERD) with [Lucidchard](https://lucid.app/) to better visualize the database architecture.

![database-driagram](/images/database.png) 

### Models
The following models were created for MyHouse.

- Category
```python
class Category(models.Model):

    class Meta:
        verbose_name_plural = 'Categories'

    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    friendly_name = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    def get_friendly_name(self):
        return self.friendly_name
```

## Ecommerce Business Model

The MyHouse is dedicated to selling products to individual customers through a simple Business to Customer model (B2B). The site is still in its early stages; however, it already offers a newsletter and social media marketing links to promote the business. By leveraging social media platforms like Facebook, we can build a community of users around the site, leading to an increase in visitor numbers and consequently more purchases.

The newsletter is an effective tool for us to communicate regular updates to our users. It is an excellent way to share information about special offers, new product updates, changes in business hours, notifications of events, and more. Our goal is to ensure that our users are always up-to-date and informed.

### Robots

The [robots.txt](robots.txt) file is at the root-level of this project.
Inside, I've included the default settings as follows:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /profiles/
Disallow: /bag/

```

### Social Media Marketing

Building a robust social network with active participation and connecting it to your business website can lead to increased sales.

I've created a Facebook business account wich can be acessed in the [following url](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61550252952582) by the time when this project was sent to Code Institute's validation, but sometimes Facebook exclude 'fake business pages' like these:

![facebook-page](documentation/facebook-page.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

In the website footer there is a newsletter sign-up form, to allow users to supply their
email address if they are interested in receiving news and discounts cupoms.

#### How to use Stripe test card
When testing interactively, use a card number, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242. Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.

- Use a valid future date, such as 12/34.
- Use any three-digit CVC (four digits for American Express cards).
- Use any value you like for other form fields.

### Browser Testing
I have tested this application works on the following installed browsers, using a Dell laptop on Windows OS:

- Microsoft Edge 112.0.1722.68
- Google Chrome Version 112.0.5615.138
- Firefox Browser 112.0.1

I have tested this application works on the following Android devices using Chrome browser 112.0.5615.138:

- Samsung Galaxy S20FE with Android 13.
- Samsung Galaxy S22 with Android 13.

### Responsiveness
I used Chrome developer tool to check the responsiveness on different screen sizes:
- 375px (Mobile)
- 728px (Tablet)
- 1024px (laptop)
- 4k (Monitor resolution)

### Automatic Testing

Django testing tools have been used to perform basic automatic testing on Guitar Store Python code for validating the main logical thing. Tests were run using the local SQLite3 database as opposed to the production PostgreSQL database. Those tests achieve 70% coverage.

Test scripts were written for all models.py, forms.py and views.py of the project apps (bag,checkout, , home, products and profiles);

models.py
views.py
forms.py

## Configuration and Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on https://myhome-1-30d4043086e4.herokuapp.com/

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: 🛑 NAME 🛑).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Amazon AWS

This project uses [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) to store media and static files online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

Once you've created an AWS account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.
Make sure you're on the **AWS Management Console** page.

#### S3 Bucket

- Search for **S3**.
- Create a new bucket, give it a name (matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
- Uncheck **Block all public access**, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).
- From **Object Ownership**, make sure to have **ACLs enabled**, and **Bucket owner preferred** selected.
- From the **Properties** tab, turn on static website hosting, and type `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
- From the **Permissions** tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

	```shell
	[
		{
			"AllowedHeaders": [
				"Authorization"
			],
			"AllowedMethods": [
				"GET"
			],
			"AllowedOrigins": [
				"*"
			],
			"ExposeHeaders": []
		}
	]
	```

- Copy your **ARN** string.
- From the **Bucket Policy** tab, select the **Policy Generator** link, and use the following steps:
	- Policy Type: **S3 Bucket Policy**
	- Effect: **Allow**
	- Principal: `*`
	- Actions: **GetObject**
	- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): **paste-your-ARN-here**
	- Click **Add Statement**
	- Click **Generate Policy**
	- Copy the entire Policy, and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**

		```shell
		{
			"Id": "Policy1234567890",
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
					"Action": [
						"s3:GetObject"
					],
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					"Principal": "*",
				}
			]
		}
		```

	- Before you click "Save", add `/*` to the end of the Resource key in the Bucket Policy Editor (like above).
	- Click **Save**.
- From the **Access Control List (ACL)** section, click "Edit" and enable **List** for **Everyone (public access)**, and accept the warning box.
	- If the edit button is disabled, you need to change the **Object Ownership** section above to **ACLs enabled** (mentioned above).

#### IAM

Back on the AWS Services Menu, search for and open **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).
Once on the IAM page, follow these steps:

- From **User Groups**, click **Create New Group**.
	- Suggested Name: `flipcart` (group + the project name)
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review policy** page.
- From **User Groups**, select your newly created group, and go to the **Permissions** tab.
- Open the **Add Permissions** dropdown, and click **Attach Policies**.
- Select the policy, then click **Add Permissions** at the bottom when finished.
- From the **JSON** tab, select the **Import Managed Policy** link.
	- Search for **S3**, select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, and then **Import**.
	- You'll need your ARN from the S3 Bucket copied again, which is pasted into "Resources" key on the Policy.

		```shell
		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": "s3:*",
					"Resource": [
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					]
				}
			]
		}
		```
	
	- Click **Review Policy**.
	- Suggested Name: `policy-flipcart` (policy + the project name)
	- Provide a description:
		- "Access to S3 Bucket for guitar-store static files."
	- Click **Create Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click your "group-guitar-store".
- Click **Attach Policy**.
- Search for the policy you've just created ("policy-guitar-store") and select it, then **Attach Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click **Add User**.
	- Suggested Name: `user-filpcart` (user + the project name)
- For "Select AWS Access Type", select **Programmatic Access**.
- Select the group to add your new user to: `group-filpkart`
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review user** page.
- Click **Create User** once done.
- You should see a button to **Download .csv**, so click it to save a copy on your system.
	- **IMPORTANT**: once you pass this page, you cannot come back to download it again, so do it immediately!
	- This contains the user's **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = **Access key ID**
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = **Secret access key**

#### Final AWS Setup

- If Heroku Config Vars has `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` still, this can be removed now, so that AWS will handle the static files.
- Back within **S3**, create a new folder called: `media`.
- Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- No further settings are required, so click **Upload**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- Add your deployed site link.
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or guitar-store
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:
- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
